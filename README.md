# INTERIO : AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY Based Interior Designer

## 1.	Tools Used

•	Unity 2018.1.0
•	Andriod Build Support
•	SDK API level 27 (Android Oreo 8.1)
•	ARCore 1.5.0


## 2.	Features
•	Place different types of furniture on any plane surfaces in real space with the help of Interio.
•	Furniture can be moved, resized, rotated according to the likes.
•	Furniture can also be colored to match and try new themes.
•	Multiple pieces of same or different furniture can be placed as per convenience.

## 3.	Details
The project uses ARCore by Google to detect surfaces and then place object aligned with those surfaces. The app uses 5 furniture models which are used from Google. These models can be moved around, rotated by a 360o, scaled to more than twice the size. 
Multiple instances of same or different models can be placed on different surfaces which can be individually managed. 
Models’ colors can also be changed to any using three RGB sliders. This feature used separate scripts to completely override the default colours with selected ones. As this feature completely changes the model texture to solid colour, it does not looks good on all models.
